        I earned my M.S. and B.S. in Computer Science from Ewha Womans
        University, conducting research in the{" "}
        <span className="highlight-text">
          Human-Computer Interaction Lab under Professor Uran Oh.{" "}
        </span>
        My research investigates how people interact with intelligent systems
        and proposes design methods to bridge usability gaps for diverse user
        groups.

        Prior to graduate school, I developed games and mobile applications,
        including a tycoon game released on Steam and productivity apps for
        Google Play. These hands-on experiences sparked my passion for creating{" "}
        interactive systems that enhance everyday life and continue to shape my
        research approach.
